On May 14th, 2024, Instruct.SI and Instruct-ERIC organized a mini-symposium entitled [**Structural biology in Slovenia and beyond**](events/mini-symposium-structural-biology-slovenia-14may24), celebrating membership of Slovenia in Instruct-ERIC. As part of the symposium, head of Instruct-ERIC operations Claudia Alén Amaro presented opportunities enabled by the membership, which was followed by inspiring lectures of Harald Schwalbe (Instruct-ERIC director), Lucia Banci (head of Instruct-IT, University of Florence), and Jiří Nováček (Instruct-CZ, CEITEC). In the second part of the meeting, young Slovenian structural biologists (PhD students and early-career postdocs) presented their work, showcasing the high level of research in this field in Slovenia.

During the meeting, Marjetka Podobnik (National Institute of Chemistry), main organizer of the conference and coordinator of Instruct.SI, and Miha Pavšič (University of Ljubljana), Instruct.SI board president, were presented with a certification of Slovenia's membership in Instruct-ERIC.

News regarding this has also been published on the [Instruct-ERIC website](https://instruct-eric.org/news/structural-biology-in-slovenia-and-beyond---an-instruct-eric-minisymposium/).
