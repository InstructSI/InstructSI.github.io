We cordially invite you to attend a workshop entitled "**Thyroid hormone cycle: biochemistry, structure, physiology, autoimmunity**", which will be held on **Wednesday, October 23, 2024**, at [**Jožef Stefan Institute**](https://ijs.si), [Jamova 39, Ljubljana](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042371&mlon=14.487311#map=19/46.042372/14.487311), in Kolar's lecture hall (department K5).

The purpose of the workshop is to boost collaboration in thyroglobulin and thyroid hormone-related research. The workshop is sponsored by [Instruct.SI](https://instruct-eric.si) to facilitate structural biology-related research.
