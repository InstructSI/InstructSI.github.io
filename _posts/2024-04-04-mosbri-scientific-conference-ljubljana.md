3rd **Molecular-Scale Biophysics Research Infrastructure ([MOSBRI](https://www.mosbri.eu/))** Scientific Conference, aiming to address the urgent need for a truly **integrated and multi-method approach to modern biophysics**, will be organised in **Ljubljana, Slovenija**, from **10th to 13th of June 2024**.

The MOSBRI conference aims to bring together a larger community of researchers from the fields of **structural biology, biochemistry, synthetic biology and biophysics**. The conference will show how an interdisciplinary and integrated network can tackle an unusually wide variety of life science research questions. It will include plenary lectures, presentations by invited renowned experts, MOSBRI partners, short oral presentations, company presentations, as well as presentations by scientists who have already benefited from the free trans-national access (TNA) opportunities that MOSBRI provides. We will make a special effort to facilitate presentations by early career scientists.

The conference is organised by [National Institute of Chemistry](https://www.ki.si/), [Instruct-ERIC](https://instruct-eric.org/), [Association of Resources for Biophysical Research in Europe](https://www.arbre-biophysics.eu/) and [Slovenian Biophysical Society](https://www.drustvo-biofizikov.si/).
