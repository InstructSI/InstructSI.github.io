We cordially invite you to attend a workshop "**GPCR Structure & Function**", which will be held on **Tuesday, December 10, 2024**, at the [**Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts**](https://www.sazu.si/), [Novi trg 3, Ljubljana](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042371&mlon=14.487311#map=19/46.042372/14.487311), in the SAZA hall.

*This year's Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine discovered mechanisms that regulate gene activity at the post-transcriptional level. This is a groundbreaking discovery, as it was previously believed that gene expression was controlled exclusively by protein factors. This finding has shifted our understanding of cell differentiation in multicellular organisms. Cell function regulation in multicellular organisms is also influenced by factors released into the extracellular space that, through receptors on the cell membrane, impact gene expression. Among these receptors are those coupled with G-proteins.*

**The workshop will cover the operation, structure, and interactions of G-protein-coupled receptors.** Before the workshop there will be an introductory lecture on the awarded Nobel Prize to Professors Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros from the USA, presented in Slovenian by Professor Tomaž Bratkovič (Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana). More details are available in the [**workshop's programme**]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/2024-gpcr-workshop-programme-2024-12-10.pdf).

The workshop is organized as part of the ***Physiology Days 2024*** by the [Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts](https://www.sazu.si/), [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.mf.uni-lj.si/) of the [University of Ljubljana](https://uni-lj.si), [Slovenian Physiological Society](http://lnmcp.mf.uni-lj.si/sfd/), and consortium [Instruct.SI](https://instruct-eric.si).

**Attendees are kindly asked to fill-out the [application form](https://www.sazu.si/events/6734987fc0a5befc4752f9fe) until December 1, 2024.** Number of attendees is limited to 60.
