Nika Žibrat, a PhD student at the Department of Molecular Biology and Nanobiotechnology, National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia, spent three months during spring 2024 at [EMBL Grenoble](https://instruct-eric.org/centre/embl-grenoble) as part of internship funded by Instruct-ERIC. Below she shared some afterthoughts on the visit.

"After hearing about Instruct-ERIC at a conference, I was immediately intrigued. Since I began my PhD studies, my goal has been to solve at least one crystal structure, and I have encountered many experimental setbacks that have hindered my experimental goals. Crystallography is part science, part art, where experience is paramount.

This spring (8. 3. – 9. 6. 2024), I spent three months at EMBL Grenoble as part of an Instruct-ERIC funded internship. The decision to apply proved to be the right one. During the internship, I was supported by staff from the HTX group, was able to apply for a comprehensive course in macromolecular crystallography at EMBL and also had the opportunity to visit the European Synchrotron Facility in Grenoble. **The time I spent at EMBL Grenoble provided two crystal structures, enriched me as a scientist and as a person and gave me self-confidence and a better understanding of professionalism in academia.**"
