**[Instruct.SI consortium](https://instruct-eric.si)** is kindly inviting to a three-day workshop "**Basics of Methodological Approaches in Structural Biology**", where atendees will be able to obtain or refresh basic knowledge on high-resolution structural biology approaches: **macromolecular crystallography (MX)**, **nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**, and **cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)**.

The workshop will be held **from 5th to 7th November 2024** at the **National Institute of Chemistry**, [Hajdrihova 19, Ljubljana](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042711&mlon=14.493613#map=19/46.042711/14.493613), as the main workshop location.

Basic info:
- **There is no fee!** All costs are covered by the Instruct.SI consortium.
- **Registration** is obligatory and will be enabled soon (**link to the registration form will be on this webpage**).
- The official language of the workshop will be **English**.
- There will be **free coffee/tea** and **free lunches**, plus a **get-together** on the last day of the workshop.

**Students and researchers, interested in structural biologyâ€”you are kindly invited!**

More info is available in the 1st announcement (published on 2024-09-17) ([English]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/2024-bmasb2024-1st_announcement-2024-09-17.pdf) and [Slovene]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/2024-bmasb2024-1_obvestilo-2024-09-17.pdf) version).
