**[Instruct.SI consortium](https://instruct-eric.si)** is kindly inviting to a three-day workshop "**Basics of Methodological Approaches in Structural Biology**", where atendees will be able to obtain or refresh basic knowledge on high-resolution structural biology approaches: **macromolecular crystallography (MX)**, **nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**, and **cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)**.

The workshop will be held **from 5th to 7th November 2024** at the **National Institute of Chemistry**, [Hajdrihova 19, Ljubljana](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042711&mlon=14.493613#map=19/46.042711/14.493613), as the main workshop location.

**Students and researchers, interested in structural biology—you are kindly invited!**
