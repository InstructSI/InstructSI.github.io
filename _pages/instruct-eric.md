**[Instruct-ERIC](https://instruct-eric.org) is a member of the family of ERICs** â€“ [European Research Infrastructure Consortia](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/european-research-infrastructures/eric_en) aimed at establishing and operating research infrastructure on a non-economic basis. It was formally established on July 4th, 2017. **Instruct-ERIC's primary objective** revolves around fostering innovation in the field of biomedical science and granting users access to advanced technologies and methodologies in structural biology:
- **Advancement of integrative structural cell biology**: Facilitating progress in the field of structural cell biology by integrating diverse methodologies and approaches.
- **Enhanced accessibility to European structural biology facilities**: Providing managed access to cutting-edge European structural biology facilities and specialized expertise for researchers.
- **Promotion of Instruct technology**: Furthering the development and utilization of the Instruct technology to empower advancements in structural biology research.
- **Training provision in integrative techniques**: Offering comprehensive training programs to equip researchers with integrative techniques crucial for breakthroughs in structural biology.

Operating with a steadfast commitment to principles, Instruct-ERIC prioritizes scientific excellence in its service provision and research support, while ensuring that transparency, equality, and legality remain fundamental aspects of its operational framework. Both academic and industry researchers worldwide can avail themselves of the comprehensive resources of Instruct, including its infrastructure, expertise, and methods. **Researchers from Instruct member countries are eligible to seek funding support for their projects.**

## Members

The consortium of Instruct-ERIC comprises 15 member [countries](https://instruct-eric.org/countries) (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and United Kingdom), plus European Molecular Biology Laboratory ([EMBL](https://www.embl.org/)) as an organization.

[Slovenia joined Instruct-ERIC in May 2023](/administration/slovenia-joins-instruct-eric), and from July 1st, 2023 on researcher from Slovenia got the same opportunities for funded access to Instruct-ERIC services as researchers from other member countries. To integrate structural biology infrastructure and better connect researchers in Slovenia as well as to catalyze further development and investments, the [Instruct.SI consortium was established in 2022](/administration/instructsi-establishment). More information on Instruct.SI is available [here](/about/).

## Financing

The financing of Instruct-ERIC's infrastructure primarily relies on contributions from member states, ensuring the organization's long-term stability. Member contributions are determined based on the number of scientists within each country, granting subscribing countries complete access to training, R&D funding, internships, and the opportunity to apply for funded access to structural biology technologies for their research endeavors. Additionally, Instruct-ERIC secures external funding through various European projects and programs, further bolstering its capacity to provide essential services.
